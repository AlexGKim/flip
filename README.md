Field Level Inference Package: a python package to infer cosmological parameters from density and velocity field

Flip is a Python package that uses the Maximum likelihood method to fit growth rate based on velocity and density field. The first part of the software is the computation of a covariance matrix from a model power spectrum and the considered coordinates. This part is generalized to work for any linear power spectrum models, both for velocities, densities, and cross-terms, and it is optimized with Hankel transform for any model. In the second part, the covariance is used to create a likelihood by multiplying it by velocities or densities. Finally, this package includes some integrated fitter such as Minuit and MCMC (with emcee) to fit the growth rate of structure.
